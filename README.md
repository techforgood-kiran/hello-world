Introduction to myself and my projects. 

I am learning to code and I was inspired by a Khan academy video that 'I can learn any thing '. I know computers and tech has changed our lives in the last century to a great extent.

I was an social entrepreneur in my previous avatar and learned then that tech when rightly used can solve some major challenges.

I have recently enrolled in the Applied AI Course by Srikanth Varma and team. Let's see how it goes.
